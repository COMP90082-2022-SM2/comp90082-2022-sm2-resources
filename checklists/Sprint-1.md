# Sprint 1 Assessment Checklist
This checklist helps you double check your work for Sprint 1. 


## Background description, client goals, motivation
- [ ] Project overview, background and goals were created.
- [ ] DO-BE-FEEL list and GOAL MODEL were created. 
- [ ] The goal model is consistent with the client understanding of the problem and with DO-BE-FEEL list.


## Personas
Make sure that your Personas satisfies the following criteria:

- [ ] 2-3 personas were developed to help with requirements validation.
- [ ] Personas are based on the research done by students and the discussion with industry partners.
- [ ] Personas are inclusive and diverse.


## Analysis of requirements (User Stories or Use Cases)

- [ ] The analysis of requirements was performed on most of the existing requirements. 
- [ ] The [new set of] requirements is consistent to the scope of the project, completely cover the new capabilities required by the client and are well documented/structured/organized on Confluence.
- [ ] The requirements can be documented in the form of user stories or use cases, supplementary specification of design/implementation/deployment requirements, prototypes, and others. It may also be necessary to be explicit about what is not in scope to define the scope boundary more clearly.

## Development environment

- [ ] Confluence is organized (cover page, project details, requirements, technical details about the project, meeting minutes and so on). 
- [ ] Trello (or Github projects or JIRA) is created, structured and organized. 
- [ ] README file is updated and provide details about the project, workflow (branches/naming conventions and so on).

## Plan

- [ ] A plan (or discussion on what to do next) was provided (requirements to develop, technologies to use, infrastructure to deploy the project) for Sprint 2 and Sprint 3. 
- [ ] Requirements were estimated and prioritized.
- [ ] Backlog items can be found in Trello (or Github project or JIRA).


## Meetings

- [ ] Meetings are recorded in Confluence and only. They were NOT exported to Github as they're part of internal process.


## GitHub 

- [ ] Folders are structured (On Canvas, visit Assignment -> "Sprint 1: Confluence Space, project background and elicitation documents" page: you can find requirements for folders' structure.)
- [ ] Sprint 1 documents were exported from Confluence and added to the repository (and are updated)
- [ ] README file is updated and explain the team's repository
- [ ] A baseline tag was generated for this Sprint (On Canvas, visit Assignment -> "Sprint 1: Confluence Space, project background and elicitation documents" page: you can find requirements for the baseline tag)
